# MLfromScratch
Library for machine learning where all algorithms are implemented from scratch. Used only numpy.

Here I tried to keep package modules in same structure as sklearn.

## Package Description

1. linear_model
	*	SGDRegressor
	*	SGDClassifier
2. tree
	*	DecisionTreeClassifier
	*	DecisionTreeRegressor
3. neighbors
	*	KNeighborsRegressor
	* 	KNeighborsClassifier
4. cluster
	*	KMeans
5. metrics
	* 	mean_squared_error
	*	root_mean_squared_error
	*	mean_absolute_error
	*	r2_score
	*	accuracy_score
	* 	confusion_matrix
	*	roc_auc_score
	*	roc_curve
	*	precision_score
	*	recall_score
	* 	sensitivity_score
	*	specificity_score
	*	f1_score
	* 	adjusted_rand_score
6. model_selection
	*	train_test_split
